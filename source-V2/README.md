LiteScript Compiler Source Version 2 
===

This .lite code is written in V1 SYNTAX, and when processed by V1 compiler,
will generate the V2 compiler, supporting V2 SYNTAX.

The V2 compiler will then be used to compile source-V3 (written in V2 SYNTAX)
to generate the V3 compiler.

This V2 version is a clean-up, enhancing code readability (from V1) 
by using V1 supplied-syntax
