	* exception.c, exception.h, test*.c, README: Changed all
	occurences of RAISE to THROW, because RAISE is signal function in
	libc. (How could I have missed that?)

	* Changed examples on the web page, added coloured HTMLs instead
	of plain source versions.

	* exception.c: Finally got time and interest in separating code;
	  previously all source was in one header, and programs from
	  multiple source files simply couldn't share exception handlers'
	  stack.

2004-05-10  Adomas <admp@licejus.lt>

	* test0.c: added.

2004-01-30  Adomas <admp@barnie>

	* README: some explantations.
	* exception.h: more documentation.
	* test7.c: an example of customized exception type.

2003-08-10  Adomas <admp@barnie>

	* exception.h: added support for GCC's __PRETTY_FUNCTION__.
	* test1.c, test2.c, test3.c, test4.c, test5.c, test6.c: Reviewed.
