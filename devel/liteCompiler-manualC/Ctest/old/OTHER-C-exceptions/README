This is excc, implementation of exceptions in C

Though to be considered a hack, it is useful outside sandbox.  Yey,
exceptions do not belong to C.  (Use C++ or Java, if you want OOP
and more.)  Well, this is finally just a hack.

Some test programs are named `testN.c'; they can be built with make
target `tests'.  Run binaries by hand.  The Source tells what should
happen.

There is also an older implementation, in file `exc-old.h'.  It does
not support nested catchers etc.  But if you can't understand this,
look at that.

Hint: code is based upon non-local jumps (setjmp interface). TRY,
EXCEPT, THROW and ON are macros.  TRY, for example, creates new
jmp_buf and pushes it onto exception stack.  EXCEPT is entered,
when THROW jumps to its jmp_buf.  ON tries to handle exception;
if it does not, exception "goes up", till the handler is found,
or top of the stack is reached (message is printed and program
terminates.)

Exception is by default numerical value (int).  See `exception.h'
for more details.

However, try to understant code yourself at first.
